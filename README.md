# Hygiene_Monitor
•Conducted in-depth analysis of hazardous gases NH3 and H2S inside washrooms by extensively reviewing relevant research papers, determining the permissible levels of the gases, and assessing their potential health risks. Collected real-time data using an IoT device.
•Created a user-friendly dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating it with the lab's QTS server through API integration and visualised live gas levels using dynamic charts. Also predicted future gas levels using weighted moving average techniques.
•Implemented EmailJS to automatically send alert messages through emails whenever the gas levels crossed a predefined threshold
